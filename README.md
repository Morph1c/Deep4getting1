# Deep4getting1
First challenge for the course of Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning.

History of model accuracy on test set:
<br>
-CNNvanilla, see CNNvanilla.ipynb, error on test set: 0.63
<br>
-Resnet with fine-tuning (128 layers), error on test set: 0.7
<br>
-ConvNextLarge fine-tuning(nicco metti layers), error on test set 0.86

For training use: convnext.ipynb for following the same preprocessing
